// This procedural code fragment performs a weak clone
// to a random neighbor.  The condition codes are the 
// same as those for instruction wmove.
//
// An example of how to use this code is as follows:
//
//    BEGIN  pushc RETURN
//	     pushc RANDWEAKMOVE
//           jumps 
//    RETURN ...

RWMGO		wmove  // move to a random neighbor (weak)
