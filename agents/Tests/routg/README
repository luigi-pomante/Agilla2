This tests the reliability of the routg operation.  Copy topoogy.nss into
$WUAPPS/Agilla/.  Then run a simulation using:

  $ build/pc/main.exe -b=0 -l=1 -r=topology.nss 16

The topology file creates a multi-hop network where nodes 0 and 8 can both
communicate with node 4, but not directly with each other, and node 4 
can communicate with both nodes 0 and 8.

After launching the simulation, inject react.ma into node 0.  Then uncomment 
the first section of react.ma and inject it again into mote 0.  Then
inject routg.ma into mote 4.  

The agent on mote 4 will periodically routg a tuple.  The last field of this
tuple will contain a value that corresponds to the number of times the
rout operation was performed.  The react.ma agent will record the 
number of times it has reacted in address 0 of its heap.  The difference
between the value in the tuple, and the value in the heap is the number of
rout operations that failed to reach the node.
