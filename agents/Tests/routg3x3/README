This tests the reliability of the routg operation in a 3x3 network. 
Use the 3x3.nss topoogy file.

  $ build/pc/main.exe -b=0 -l=1 -r=3x3.nss 9

Inject react.ma into node 0.  It will clone itself onto every node around
the perimeter of the network.

Inject routg.ma into node 0.  It will migrate to node 4, and then perform
routg operations.  All of the agents surrounding node 4 will react to it.

If you only want one routg operation, you can inject routg_once.ma.
