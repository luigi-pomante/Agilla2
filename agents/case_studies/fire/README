These agents model and track fire.  They were evaluated in the following

Fire_Dynamic_40.ma:
Fire_Dynamic_56.ma:
Fire_Dynamic_75.ma:
Fire_Dynamic_100.ma:
Fire_Dynamic_random.ma:
  These are agents modeling fire that epidemically spread throughout the 
  network.  Fire is modeled using a tuple containing <"fir">.  Whenever this
  tuple exists in the local tuple space, the mote holding the tuple space
  is considered to be on fire.  The number in the agent's name indicates the
  number of times the agent blinks its red LED before trying to clone itself
  onto a remote mote.  Naturally, the larger the number the slower the fire
  spreads.

Fire_Static.ma:  
  This fire agent does not spread, nor blink its RED led (it just keeps the 
  red LED on after inserting a fire tuple).

Fire_Static_Blink.ma: 
  Same as Fire_Static.ma except it continuously blinks the RED led.
  
Fire_Top_2_Rows.ma:
  Spreads a fire across the top two rows.  It must be injected into the 
  upper-left mote.
  
Tracker_Linear_Up_Adaptive.ma:
  A fire tracking agent that travels up a column until it finds a fire, at 
  which point it clones itself in both horizontal directions until the fire's
  perimeter is mapped.

Tracker.ma:
  A fire tracking agent that randomly traverses the network until a fire is
  found, at which point it starts forming and maintaining a perimeter around
  the fire.
