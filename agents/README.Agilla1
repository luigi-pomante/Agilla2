This file contains descriptions of the agents in the local directory.

3Blink:
  Blinks all three LEDs three times, and then halts
  
3BlinkContinuous:
  Blinks all three LEDs three times, pauses, and repeats indefinitely.

BlinkRedLEDContinuous:
  Repeatedly blinks the red LED.  Runs indefinitely.

Bounce0to1:
  Blinks the red LED once.  Then, if the agent is on mote 0, it
  migrates to performs a weak move to node 1.  Upon arriving at node 1,
  it again blinks the red LED, then halts.

Bounce0to1Continuous:
  Same as Bounce0to1 except it performs a weak move to mote 0 when it
  is at mote 1, resulting in it bouncing between motes 0 and 1 
  indefinitely.

CntToLedsHP:
  Count up using the heap to store the counter, displays the last 
  three bits of the counter on the LEDs.

CntToLedsTS.ma 
  Same as CntToLedsHP except it stores the current value in a tuple
  in the local tuple space.
  
MigrateToUart:
  Blinks the green LED 5 times, them migrates to location
  (uart_x, uart_y).  Inject it anywhere into the network
  and it should arrive back at the base station.

MigrateToUartA:
  Same as MigrateToUart except it does migrate to TinyOS
  address uart.

MigraetToUartStrong:
  Same as MigrateToUartA except it migrates a really fat agent containing
  multiple code, stack, heap, and reaction messages.
