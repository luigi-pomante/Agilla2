This is an example application that uses mobile agents to
collect light readings for display on an oscilloscope GUI.

Run it by injecting an Oscilloscope agent and loading the 
Oscilloscope client on the AgentInjector by going to 
Experiments -> Show Oscope.

There are two types of Oscilloscope agents:  
  1) OscopeOneReadingPerMsg.ma
  2) OscilloscopeFiveReadingsPerMsg.ma

The first agent sends a single sensor reading at a time
while the second sends 5 sensor readings at a time.  The first
agent is able to detect dropped packets, whereas the second
one cannot.
